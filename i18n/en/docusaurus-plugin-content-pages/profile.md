# About Me

Hello, my name is `Hiroaki`, and I am the administrator of this site. Thank you for visiting.


## Overview
Driven by a long-held dream of software development and a curiosity about the mechanisms of our rapidly changing society and technology, I strive to improve my skills every day.
My professional experience in the public sector, where I learned about the structures of society, also informs my current learning and creative activities in the IT field.

On this site, I aim to share the skills I've acquired and my daily insights, both as a record of my own growth and as information that might be useful to others.
I am actively learning new knowledge and technologies, aiming to create interesting products and services on my own.


## Personality
* Inquisitiveness
    * I have a strong curiosity about the unknown and new things, and I try to delve deep to understand them.
* Long-term Perspective
    * I value acting with an eye toward future value and impact, not just immediate results.
* Focus and Perseverance
    * I may not be the most dexterous type, but once I become interested in something or set a goal, I immerse myself deeply and tackle it with perseverance.
* Commitment to Improvement and Growth
    * I am never satisfied with the status quo and am conscious of always seeking better methods and continuing to learn.
* Cooperativeness
    * I genuinely like people. I find joy in collaborating with a team to achieve common goals.
* Empathy
    * I value human connections and compassion, and I always try to consider things from others' perspectives.
