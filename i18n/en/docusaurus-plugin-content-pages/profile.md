# About Me

Hello, I'm `Hiroaki`, the administrator. Thank you for visiting this site.

## Overview
Driven by a long-held dream of software development and a curiosity about the mechanisms of our rapidly changing society and technology, I strive to improve my skills daily.
My experience in the administrative field, where I learned about societal structures, also informs my current learning and creative activities in the IT field.

On this site, I aim to share the technologies I've learned and my daily insights as a record of my own growth and as information that might be helpful to others.
I am committed to actively learning new knowledge and technologies, with the goal of creating interesting products and services myself.

## Personality
* Inquisitiveness
    * I have a strong curiosity for unknown and new things, and I try to delve deep to understand them.
* Long-term Perspective
    * I prioritize acting with an eye on future value and impact, not just immediate results.
* Focus and Perseverance
    * I may not be the most dexterous type, but once I become interested in something or set a goal, I immerse myself deeply and work tenaciously.
* Mindset for Improvement and Growth
    * I am not content with the status quo and am conscious of exploring better methods and continuing to learn.
* Cooperativeness
    * I genuinely like people. I find joy in collaborating with a team to achieve goals.
* Empathy
    * I value connections with people and compassion, and I try to think from others' perspectives.
