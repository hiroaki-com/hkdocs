# About Me

Hello, my name is `Hiroaki`, and I'm the administrator of this site. Thank you for visiting.

## Overview
Driven by a long-held dream of software development and a curiosity about the mechanisms of our rapidly changing society and technology, I am dedicated to improving my skills daily.
My professional experience in the public sector, where I gained insight into the workings of society, also enriches my current learning and creative endeavors in the IT field.

On this site, I aim to share the skills I've acquired and my daily insights, both as a record of my own growth and as information that might be helpful to others.
I aspire to proactively learn new knowledge and technologies and to create interesting products and services myself.

## Personality
* **Inquisitive**
    * I have a strong curiosity for the unknown and new things, and I strive to understand them in depth.
* **Long-term Perspective**
    * I prioritize acting with an eye on future value and impact, not just short-term results.
* **Focused and Persistent**
    * I may not be the most dexterous type, but once I become interested in something or set a goal, I immerse myself in it deeply and work on it tenaciously.
* **Commitment to Improvement and Growth**
    * I am never satisfied with the status quo and am always conscious of seeking better methods and continuing to learn.
* **Cooperative**
    * I genuinely like people and find joy in collaborating with a team to achieve goals.
* **Empathetic**
    * I value connections and compassion, and I always try to put myself in others' shoes.
