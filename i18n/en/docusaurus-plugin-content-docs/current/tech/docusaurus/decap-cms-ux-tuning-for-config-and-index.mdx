In a previous article, I explained [how to integrate Decap CMS into a Docusaurus site](i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/tech/docusaurus/docusaurus-decap-cms-with-cloud-run-and-netlify.mdx). While this setup provided a solid foundation for content updates, I found room for improvement in day-to-day use, especially regarding mobile usability and streamlining repetitive input.

This article details the practical customizations I applied to [**`static/admin/config.yml`**](https://github.com/hiroaki-com/hkdocs/blob/main/static/admin/config.yml) and [**`static/admin/index.html`**](https://github.com/hiroaki-com/hkdocs/blob/main/static/admin/index.html) to address these challenges.

-   **`config.yml` optimization**: Settings to reduce manual input and prevent errors.
-   **`index.html` modification**: Adding CSS and JavaScript to improve mobile usability.

These tweaks have created an environment where I can comfortably update articles not only from a PC but also from a smartphone. I hope this serves as a helpful example of leveraging the high customizability of Git-based CMS.

### **1. Enhancing Operational Efficiency with `config.yml`**

The [**`config.yml`**](https://github.com/hiroaki-com/hkdocs/blob/main/static/admin/config.yml) file is not just for defining CMS fields and storage locations; it's a flexible configuration file where you can build in "tricks" to streamline daily operations.

#### Enhancement 1: Automating Commit Messages with Conventional Commits

When content is updated via the CMS, a Git commit history is created. To make this history easy to understand later, I configured it to automatically generate messages that follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

In the `commit_messages` section, you can specify templates for actions like `create`, `update`, etc. Using placeholders like `{{slug}}` and `{{path}}`, it's easy to see at a glance which file was affected.

```yaml title="static/admin/config.yml"
backend:
  name: git-gateway
  branch: main
  # Customize commit messages to follow the convention
  commit_messages:
    create: 'docs(diary): add new entry "{{slug}}"'
    update: 'docs(diary): revise entry "{{slug}}"'
    delete: 'docs(diary): remove entry "{{slug}}"'
    uploadMedia: 'docs(assets): add media "{{path}}"'
    deleteMedia: 'docs(assets): remove media "{{path}}"'
```

This ensures that even updates from the CMS maintain a high-quality log, comparable to manual commits.

#### Enhancement 2: Improving the Writing Experience by Automating Repetitive Tasks

For content like a daily diary, automating a few tasks can significantly improve the writing experience.

-   **Automatic file naming**: By specifying a date-based template (`{{year}}-{{month}}-{{day}}`) for the `slug`, I eliminated the need to manually think of file names and ensured a consistent naming convention.
-   **Template insertion**: By setting default values with headings in the `body` field, a template is automatically inserted when creating a new entry, allowing me to start writing immediately.
-   **Enabling real-time preview**: Setting `editor: preview: true` allows me to check the rendered output in a side pane while writing Markdown.

```yaml title="static/admin/config.yml"
collections:
  - name: "diary"
    label: "Diary"
    folder: "diary"
    create: true
    slug: "{{year}}-{{month}}-{{day}}" # Automatically generate file names with dates
    editor:
      preview: true  # Enable Markdown preview
    fields:
      # ... (omitted) ...
      - label: "Body"
        name: "body"
        widget: "markdown"
        # Template to be automatically inserted on new entry creation
        default: "### About the Weather\n\n\n<!-- truncate -->\n\n\n### About My Condition\n\n\n### About My Work\n\n\n### Other\n\n"
```

These settings allow me to focus on the content itself without interrupting my train of thought.

#### Enhancement 3: Automating Repetitive Input with Hidden Fields

The author of the article is always myself, so entering it every time is inefficient. Such fixed values can be automatically set without being visible to the user by combining `widget: "hidden"` and `default`.

```yaml title="static/admin/config.yml"
# ...
fields:
  - label: "Authors"
    name: "authors"
    widget: "hidden" # Hide from the UI
    default: ["hk"]   # Set a default value
```

This allows necessary metadata to be added without the user even thinking about it.

### **2. Improving Mobile UX with `index.html`**

The default UI of Decap CMS is primarily designed for PC use, and its usability on smartphones left room for improvement. To solve this, I directly added custom CSS and JavaScript to [**`static/admin/index.html`**](https://github.com/hiroaki-com/hkdocs/blob/main/static/admin/index.html) to enhance the mobile experience.

#### Enhancement 1: Global UI Optimization with Custom CSS

Inside the `<style>` tag of `index.html`, I added smartphone-specific styles using the `@media (max-width:799px)` media query, along with other fine-tuned adjustments.

-   **Layout adjustments**: I adjusted the size of buttons and input forms and hid unnecessary UI elements to maximize screen space.
-   **Preventing auto-zoom on iOS**: By setting the `font-size` of `input` and `textarea` to `16px` or more, I suppressed the automatic zoom behavior when a form is selected.
-   **Unifying layout standards**: Applying `box-sizing: border-box;` globally prevents unintentional layout breaks caused by CSS customizations.
-   **Font optimization**: Specifying system fonts (`-apple-system`, `Roboto`, etc.) ensures a natural and readable display on each OS.

```html title="Part of static/admin/index.html"
<style>
  @media (max-width:799px){
    /* ...layout adjustment CSS... */
    [data-slate-editor="true"], input, textarea {
      font-size: 16px !important;
    }
  }
  *, *::before, *::after {
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
  body {
    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Noto Sans JP', 'Yu Gothic UI', Roboto, sans-serif;
  }
</style>
```

#### Enhancement 2: Improving Interactions with JavaScript

I also made improvements to usability, not just appearance, with JavaScript.

-   **Disabling "pull-to-refresh"**: This prevents accidental page reloads when swiping down on the screen while editing on a mobile browser. It monitors `touchstart` and `touchmove` events and cancels only downward swipes at the very top of the page.
-   **Automatic redirect after logout**: After the logout process is complete, it automatically redirects to the login page (`/admin/`). This prevents users from getting confused about what to do next.

```html title="Part of static/admin/index.html"
<script>
  (function() {
    function preventPullToRefresh() {
      // ... pull-to-refresh prevention logic ...
    }
    
    if (window.netlifyIdentity) {
      // Redirect to the login page on logout
      window.netlifyIdentity.on("logout", () => { document.location.href = "/admin/"; });
    }
    
    window.addEventListener('load', preventPullToRefresh);
  })();
</script>
```

These scripts effectively reduce stress from accidental operations without hindering intended scrolling behavior.

### **Conclusion**

By modifying just two files, `config.yml` and `index.html`, you can significantly improve the usability of Decap CMS.

-   **`config.yml`**: Enhance **operational efficiency** by automating input using `slug` and `default` values.
-   **`index.html`**: Improve **mobile UX** by adjusting the UI and interactions with custom CSS and JavaScript.

A major advantage of Git-based CMS is the flexibility to customize it to your own workflow. I hope this article provides some hints for making your CMS environment more comfortable.
