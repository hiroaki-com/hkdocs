This article outlines the steps I took to set up a custom domain, `hkdocs.com`, acquired from Value Domain, for this Docusaurus site hosted on Google Cloud Run.

<Admonition type="info" title="Prerequisites">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Domain:</strong> <code>hkdocs.com</code> (already acquired from <a href="https://www.value-domain.com/">Value Domain</a>)</li>
    <li><strong>Hosting:</strong> Google Cloud Run</li>
    <li><strong>Site Generator:</strong> Docusaurus</li>
  </ul>
</Admonition>

### 1. Update Docusaurus Configuration File

First, modify the configuration file so that your Docusaurus site recognizes the new domain, `hkdocs.com`.

1.  Open the `docusaurus.config.ts` (or `.js`) file in your Docusaurus project.
2.  Change the `url` property to `https://hkdocs.com/`.
    ```typescript title="docusaurus.config.ts"
    // docusaurus.config.ts
    const config: Config = {
      // ...
      url: 'https://hkdocs.com/', // Change this to your actual domain
      baseUrl: '/',
      // Set organizationName and projectName appropriately
      // ...
    };
    ```
3.  Ensure that `organizationName` (e.g., `hiroaki-com`) and `projectName` (e.g., `hkdocs`) are correctly set to align with the `editUrl` of your GitHub repository.
4.  Save the file.

### 2. Start Custom Domain Mapping in Cloud Run

Next, begin the process of associating `hkdocs.com` with your Cloud Run service in the Google Cloud Console.

1.  Log in to the **Google Cloud Console** and select the **Cloud Run service** that hosts `hkdocs.com`.
2.  Select "**Map Custom Domain**" (or a similar menu option) and click "Add mapping".
3.  In the "Enter domain" field, type `hkdocs.com` and click "Continue".
4.  Cloud Run will provide you with **TXT record** information to verify your domain ownership. Make a careful note of this value.
    *   Example: Hostname `@` (or `hkdocs.com.`), Value `google-site-verification=some-random-string`

### 3. Configure DNS Records in Value Domain (TXT Record)

In the Value Domain control panel, set the TXT record as instructed by Cloud Run.

1.  Log in to the **Value Domain Control Panel**.
2.  Navigate to the "Change DNS records/URL forwarding" page (or the DNS settings page) for your domain, `hkdocs.com`.
3.  In the DNS record input area, add the TXT record information you noted in step 2.
    *   Enter the information according to Value Domain's format.
    *   **Example entry:**
        ```dns
        # TXT record for domain ownership verification
        txt @ google-site-verification=some-random-string
        ```
        *(Use the actual value provided for `google-site-verification=`)*
4.  Save the DNS settings. It may take a few minutes to several hours for the DNS changes to propagate across the internet.

### 4. Verify Ownership and Get A/AAAA Records in Cloud Run

Once Cloud Run recognizes the TXT record, it will display the A and AAAA records you need to set next.

1.  Return to the Cloud Run custom domain mapping screen in the **Google Cloud Console**.
2.  Once ownership verification is complete, Cloud Run will display the **A records (IPv4 addresses) and AAAA records (IPv6 addresses)** needed to direct traffic to your service. Make a careful note of all these IP addresses.
    *   **Example A records (dummy):** `198.51.100.10`, `198.51.100.11`, `198.51.100.12`, `198.51.100.13`
    *   **Example AAAA records (dummy):** `2001:db8:2::1a`, `2001:db8:2::1b`, `2001:db8:2::1c`, `2001:db8:2::1d`

<Admonition type="note">
  These IP addresses are just examples. You must use the specific IP addresses provided by Cloud Run.
</Admonition>

### 5. Configure DNS Records in Value Domain (A/AAAA Records)

Go back to the Value Domain DNS settings screen to set the A/AAAA records you obtained.

1.  Open the DNS settings page for `hkdocs.com` in **Value Domain**.
2.  <Admonition type="warning" title="Important">
    If there are any existing A, AAAA, or CNAME records for your website set on <code>hkdocs.com</code> (hostname <code>@</code>), you must delete them or comment them out by adding a <code>#</code> at the beginning of the line. This is to prevent conflicts with the Cloud Run settings. Do not change mail-related MX records.
    </Admonition>
3.  Add the A and AAAA records you noted in step 4, following Value Domain's format.
    *   **Example entry (replace the dummy IP addresses with the actual values from step 4):**
        ```dns
        # Settings to point hkdocs.com to Cloud Run
        # A Records (IPv4)
        a @ 198.51.100.10
        a @ 198.51.100.11
        a @ 198.51.100.12
        a @ 198.51.100.13

        # AAAA Records (IPv6)
        aaaa @ 2001:db8:2::1a
        aaaa @ 2001:db8:2::1b
        aaaa @ 2001:db8:2::1c
        aaaa @ 2001:db8:2::1d
        ```
4.  Save the DNS settings and wait for the changes to propagate.

### 6. Final Verification and SSL Certificate Issuance in Cloud Run

Confirm that Cloud Run has recognized the new DNS settings and has issued an SSL certificate.

1.  In the **Google Cloud Console**, on the Cloud Run custom domain mapping screen, check that the status for `hkdocs.com` is "Active" and that an SSL certificate has been issued. This may take some time.

### 7. Rebuild and Deploy Docusaurus Site

To apply the changes made to the Docusaurus configuration, rebuild your site and deploy it to Cloud Run.

1.  In your local terminal, navigate to the root directory of your Docusaurus project.
2.  Run the build command (e.g., `pnpm build`, `npm run build`, `yarn build`).
3.  Deploy the built static files to your Cloud Run service.

### 8. Verify Operation

Finally, check that your site is correctly displayed at the configured custom domain, `https://hkdocs.com/`.

1.  In a web browser, go to `https://hkdocs.com/`.
2.  Verify that the site is displayed and that the HTTPS connection is active (check for the lock icon in the address bar).
3.  Test that the links and features on the site work as expected.
4.  If necessary, also check SEO-related files like `https://hkdocs.com/sitemap.xml`.
