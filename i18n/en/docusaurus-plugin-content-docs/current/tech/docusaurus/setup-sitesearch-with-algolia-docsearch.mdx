This article outlines the steps and troubleshooting process for setting up an internal site search feature using Algolia DocSearch.

### A Record of Implementing Algolia DocSearch in Docusaurus

Service Used:
- [Algolia DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/)

#### 1. Applying for Algolia DocSearch

1.  **Access the DocSearch Official Website**
    Go to the [Algolia DocSearch official website](https://docsearch.algolia.com/).

2.  **Submit the Application Form**
    Follow the instructions on the site to fill out and submit the application with your site's URL and repository information.

3.  **Obtain Key Information**
    After your application is approved, you will receive the following three pieces of information from Algolia:
    *   `appId` (Application ID)
    *   `apiKey` (Search-Only API Key)
    *   `indexName` (Index Name)

#### 2. Update `docusaurus.config.ts`

1.  **Add `algolia` Configuration to the Config File**
    Open `docusaurus.config.ts` in your project root and add an `algolia` property within the `themeConfig` object.

2.  **Configuration Details**
    Set the key information you obtained for each item.

    ```typescript title="docusaurus.config.ts"
    // docusaurus.config.ts
    // ...
    themeConfig: {
      // ...other settings...

      algolia: {
        // The application ID provided by Algolia
        appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',

        // Public API key: safe to commit
        apiKey: 'YOUR_SEARCH_API_KEY',

        // The name of the Algolia index
        indexName: 'YOUR_INDEX_NAME',

        // Recommended: enable contextual search
        contextualSearch: true,

        // Optional: path for the search page (defaults to 'search')
        searchPagePath: 'search',
      },
    },
    // ...
    ```

#### 3. Create the Index with the Algolia Crawler

1.  **Initial Crawl**
    After the DocSearch team completes the crawl configuration, your site's content will be initially indexed by Algolia.

2.  **Check Crawler Configuration**
    If necessary, check the crawl target URLs and exclusion settings in the Algolia dashboard.

3.  **Automatic Content Updates**
    After your site is updated, the DocSearch crawler will periodically detect changes and automatically update the search index.

    <Admonition type="warning" title="Note">
      The search function will not work until the crawl is complete and the index is populated with data.
    </Admonition>

#### 4. Verify Operation

1.  **Start the Local Development Server**
    Start the development server with a command like `pnpm start`.

2.  **Check Search UI Display**
    Confirm that a search box is displayed in your site's navigation bar.

3.  **Test Search Functionality**
    Enter keywords and test whether the search results are displayed correctly.

4.  **Build and Deploy**
    After local verification, build the site with a command like `pnpm build` and deploy it to your production environment. Re-verify the operation after deployment.

### Addendum: Troubleshooting and Resolving Search Functionality Failure

#### 1. The Incident

*   **Symptom**
    The search box was displayed, but entering keywords only returned the site title, and the content of articles and individual pages was not being searched.
*   **Attempts**
    Manually triggering crawls from the Algolia dashboard and modifying CSS selectors in the crawler configuration did not resolve the issue.
*   **Error**
    The crawler logs showed a `Too many missing records` error. The index update was being blocked by a safety mechanism because the new crawl retrieved zero records.

#### 2. The Cause

**The Algolia crawler was navigating the site without executing JavaScript.**

Docusaurus v3 is a Single Page Application (SPA) that renders content dynamically using JavaScript. The default crawler setting (`renderJavaScript: false`) was reading the pre-JavaScript execution HTML (which was empty), so there was no text to be indexed.

#### 3. The Solution

**Change the Algolia crawler configuration.**

1.  Open the configuration editor for the target crawler in the Algolia dashboard.
2.  Change the `renderJavaScript: false` setting to `true`.

    ```javascript title="Algolia Crawler Configuration File"
    // Algolia Crawler Configuration File
    new Crawler({
      // ...
      renderJavaScript: true,
      // ...
    });
    ```

This change made the crawler read the fully rendered HTML after JavaScript execution, allowing the CSS selectors to correctly extract the body content.

#### 4. Lessons Learned

*   When applying Algolia to SPAs like Docusaurus v2+, React, or Vue, the `renderJavaScript: true` setting is likely essential.
*   If "the selectors are correct but no data is being extracted," the first thing to check is the crawler's JavaScript rendering setting.
*   Using the crawler's test run feature (Run a test) to check the raw HTML it retrieves is extremely effective for isolating the problem.
