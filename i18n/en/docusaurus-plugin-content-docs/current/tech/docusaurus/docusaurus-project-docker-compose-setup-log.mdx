This article documents the steps for introducing `Docker Compose` to a Docusaurus project for local development.

:::info[Background]
To unify the local development environment and simplify setup, Docker Compose was introduced to a Docusaurus (`v3.8.0`) project. Before this, the setup involved directly installing Node.js (`v22.16.0`) and pnpm (`v10.11.0`) on each developer's local machine.

#### 1. Creating the Development Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.dev`)

To define a Docker image specifically for local development, `Dockerfile.dev` was created with the following steps:

1.  **File Creation**
    A file named `Dockerfile.dev` was created in the project root.

2.  **Specify Base Image**
    To maintain consistency with the production `Dockerfile`, `node:22.16.0-alpine` was specified as the base image.

3.  **Enable pnpm and Install Dependencies**
    After running `corepack enable pnpm`, `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` are copied into the container, and all packages, including development dependencies, are installed using `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.

4.  **Expose Port and Set Startup Command**
    The default Docusaurus development port `3000` is exposed, and the startup command is set to `pnpm start --host 0.0.0.0 --no-open`. This allows access from outside the container while suppressing the unnecessary automatic opening of a browser.

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile.dev"
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM node:22.16.0-alpine AS development

WORKDIR /app

RUN corepack enable pnpm

COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["pnpm", "start", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--no-open"]
```

#### 2. Creating the Docker Compose Configuration File (`docker-compose.yml`)

To define and manage the development service, `docker-compose.yml` was created with the following steps:

1.  **File Creation**
    A file named `docker-compose.yml` was created in the project root.

2.  **Service Definition**
    A development service named `app` was defined, with the container name set to `hkdocs_dev_app`. The build context was set to the project root (`.`), and the Dockerfile to be used was specified as `Dockerfile.dev`.

3.  **Port Mapping Configuration**
    The host's port `3000` is mapped to the container's port `3000`.

4.  **Volume Mount Configuration**
    For source code synchronization, `.:/app:cached` was set. To isolate the `node_modules` and `.docusaurus` directories, `/app/node_modules` and `/app/.docusaurus` were configured as container-specific volumes.

5.  **Environment Variables and Other Settings**
    `NODE_ENV=development` was set. `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true` is prepared but commented out for cases of unstable hot reloading. For interactive execution, `tty: true` and `stdin_open: true` were set.

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    container_name: hkdocs_dev_app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app:cached
      - /app/node_modules
      - /app/.docusaurus
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      # CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
```

#### 3. Updating the Docker Build Context Exclusion File (`.dockerignore`)

To optimize the Docker image build efficiency and size, the `.dockerignore` file was updated. The main exclusions include `.git`, `node_modules`, `build`, `.docusaurus`, Docker-related files themselves, deployment scripts, environment-specific files, log files, OS-specific files, and IDE configuration files.

:::caution Note
Since `pnpm-lock.yaml` is used by the `COPY` command inside `Dockerfile.dev`, it is not included in the `.dockerignore` file.
:::

```dockerignore title=".dockerignore"
# Git
.git
.gitignore

# Node.js
node_modules

# Docusaurus build output and cache
build
.docusaurus

# Docker related files
Dockerfile
Dockerfile.dev
docker-compose.yml
docker-compose.*.yml

# Deployment scripts & environment specific files
deploy.sh
.env
*.local

# Logs
*.log
pnpm-debug.log*

# IDE/Editor specific
.DS_Store
.vscode/
.idea/
```

#### 4. Using and Verifying the Development Environment

1.  **Starting the Development Environment**
    From the terminal in the project root directory, start the development environment using `docker-compose up --build` for the first time or after changing configuration files. For subsequent starts, use `docker-compose up`.

2.  **Verifying in the Browser**
    Access `http://localhost:3000` in a browser and confirm that the Docusaurus site is displayed.

3.  **Testing Hot Reload**
    Edit and save a source code file in your editor on the host machine and confirm that the changes are immediately reflected in the browser (hot reload).

    :::tip If Hot Reload is Unstable
    You can address this by uncommenting `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true` in `docker-compose.yml`, or by adding the `--poll` option to the `CMD` in `Dockerfile.dev` and restarting with `docker-compose up --build`.
    :::

4.  **Stopping the Development Environment**
    Stop the containers by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the development server is running. To completely remove the containers and associated resources (like networks), run the `docker-compose down` command.
