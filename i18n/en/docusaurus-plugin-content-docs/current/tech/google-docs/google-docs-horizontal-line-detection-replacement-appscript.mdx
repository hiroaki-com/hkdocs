# "Find/Replace Horizontal Rule" Apps Script for Google Docs

### Background
- I needed to bulk-replace horizontal rules, which were used as separators in a document, with a specific text (e.g., "Replacement Text").
- These horizontal rules (---) were generated when a Markdown file was converted to a Google Doc and were not detectable by the standard find/replace function (`⌘＋F`／`⌘＋H`).
- Manual, visual replacement was inefficient, highlighting the need to streamline this repetitive task.
- This script was created to automate such routine replacement tasks and improve editing efficiency.

### Use Cases
- Bulk-replace all horizontal rules in a document with a specified fixed string (in this script, "Replacement Text").
- Can be used, for example, to convert places where horizontal rules were used as temporary separators into formal section headings or annotations.
- Streamlines the process of formatting a large number of documents to ensure a consistent handling of horizontal rules.

### How to Use
1.  Open a Google Docs document.
2.  From the menu bar, select "Extensions" > "Apps Script" to open the script editor.
3.  Copy and paste the entire script below into the script editor that appears.

    :::info Note
    If other scripts already exist, either create a new script file ("File" > "New" > "Script file") and paste the code there, or append it to the end of the existing code.
    :::
4.  Save the script by clicking the floppy disk icon ("Save project") at the top of the script editor.
5.  At the top of the script editor, select `replaceHorizontalRules` as the function to run. (It's usually selected automatically if it's the only function.)
6.  Click the play icon ("Run") to execute the script.

    :::caution First-Time Execution Note
    On the first run, an "Authorization required" dialog will appear. Follow the prompts to authorize the script.
    :::

7.  After execution, all horizontal rules in the document will be replaced with the text "Replacement Text".

```javascript title="replace-horizontal-rules.js"
function replaceHorizontalRules() {
  const body = DocumentApp.getActiveDocument().getBody();
  const hrArray = [];

  // 1) Collect all horizontal rules
  // Search for HORIZONTAL_RULE elements in the document body.
  let res = body.findElement(DocumentApp.ElementType.HORIZONTAL_RULE);
  while (res) {
    // Add the found horizontal rule element to the hrArray.
    // findElement returns a RangeElement, so we use getElement() to get the actual Element.
    hrArray.push(res.getElement());
    // Search for the next horizontal rule, starting from the current result (res).
    res = body.findElement(DocumentApp.ElementType.HORIZONTAL_RULE, res);
  }

  // 2) Replace from the end of the array
  // Processing from the end of the array avoids issues with changing the indices
  // of elements at the front when deleting or inserting.
  for (let i = hrArray.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    const hr = hrArray[i];                       // Get the horizontal rule element from the array
    const para = hr.getParent();                 // Get the parent paragraph element containing the horizontal rule
    const parentBody = para.getParent();         // Get the parent of that paragraph (usually the document Body)
    const index = parentBody.getChildIndex(para); // Get the position (index) of the paragraph within the Body

    // Remove the entire paragraph containing the horizontal rule.
    // This is because a horizontal rule is typically treated as its own separate paragraph.
    parentBody.removeChild(para);
    // Insert a new paragraph with the text "Replacement Text" at the original paragraph's location.
    parentBody.insertParagraph(index, 'Replacement Text');
  }
}
```
