When you share a tool or product on GitHub or social media, attaching a demo video or GIF makes a huge difference in how well it communicates.
But the moment you actually try to convert a video, you hit a wall: "SaaS tools require a subscription," "local apps are bloated," or "I have to look up the FFmpeg command every single time."

So I built a tool that runs FFmpeg in Google Colab's free environment and converts screen recordings directly to GIF or MP4 — no environment setup, no software installation, just a browser.

### Why I Built This

Embedding a GIF in a GitHub README noticeably improves a project's first impression. Because visitors can instantly see the tool in action, I think it also increases the chances they'll actually read the page.

That said, the process of converting a screen recording to GIF has always been quietly tedious.

- **SaaS tools**: Convenient because everything runs in the browser, but fine-grained quality settings often require a paid plan.
- **Local GUI apps**: Some are downloadable and usable, but they tend to break with OS updates and become a maintenance headache.
- **Using FFmpeg directly**: The most flexible option, but looking up the right options every time is a drag. I always forget how to write the `palettegen` + `paletteuse` combination.

As an engineer, getting up to speed on video conversion tools isn't where my learning should go, and paying ongoing SaaS fees didn't sit right either. I figured I'd rather build something myself that I could reuse however I wanted.

Google Colab lets you run FFmpeg for free, and building a UI inside a notebook means I never have to type the same commands again. That was the idea behind this tool.

### How to Use It

No Python code required. Just run the cells from top to bottom and interact with the UI.

#### ① Setup

Run the first cell. FFmpeg installs automatically.

#### ② Upload Your Video

A file selection dialog opens — choose the video(s) you want to convert. Select multiple files if you want to merge them together.

Supported input formats: `.mov` `.mp4` `.avi` `.mkv` `.webm`

#### ③ Set the Merge Order (for multiple files)

If you uploaded multiple videos, use the dropdowns to specify the order they should be merged. This step is skipped automatically for a single file.

#### ④ Configure Output Format, Quality, and Speed

Use the radio buttons to select your output format and quality.

**Choosing an Output Format**

| Format | Characteristics | Best For | Not Ideal For |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| GIF | Auto-plays, loops, works in any Markdown renderer. 256 colors, larger file size. | GitHub README, Zenn / Qiita | Size-constrained environments |
| MP4 (H.264) | High quality, small file size, full color. Requires a media player. | X / Slack / GitHub README (click-to-play) | Scenarios requiring auto-play or looping |

**GIF Quality Presets**

| Preset | Width | FPS | Colors | Use Case |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| GitHub README | 960px | 15fps | 256 | README embedding (recommended) |
| SNS / Lightweight | 640px | 10fps | 128 | Minimize file size |
| High Quality | 1280px | 20fps | 256 | Quality-first output |
| Custom | any | any | any | Fine-grained control |

**MP4 Quality Presets**

| Preset | CRF | Notes |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| High Quality | 18 | Larger file size |
| Standard | 23 | Balanced (recommended) |
| Lightweight | 28 | Smaller file size |
| Custom | 0–51 | Fine-grained control |

You can also adjust playback speed. Bumping a long recording to 1.5x or 2.0x is a great way to condense it into a tighter demo.

#### ⑤ Run the Conversion

Press the play button (▶) to start. If you want to tweak the settings and redo the conversion, just change the settings in step ④ and re-run this cell — no need to start from the top.

#### ⑥ Preview the Result

Once conversion finishes, you can preview the output directly inside the notebook. GIFs display inline; MP4s embed a player.

#### ⑦ Save

Select a save destination using the radio buttons and run the cell.

| Destination | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Download locally | Saved via the browser download dialog |
| Save to Google Drive | Auto-copied to the specified path (includes mount step) |
| Both | Executes both options simultaneously |

### Key Features and Technical Notes

A few things I put thought into:

- **High-quality GIF conversion**

  GIF output quality depends heavily on FFmpeg filter configuration. This tool uses a two-pass `palettegen` + `paletteuse` approach:
```
  [0:v] fps=15,scale=960:-1:flags=lanczos,split [a][b];
  [a] palettegen=max_colors=256:stats_mode=full [p];
  [b][p] paletteuse=dither=floyd_steinberg:diff_mode=rectangle
```

  The `lanczos` filter improves resize quality, and `floyd_steinberg` dithering produces smoother color gradients. Custom mode also supports `bayer` dithering, letting you tune the quality-vs-file-size tradeoff.

- **Automatic file size warning**

  If a GIF exceeds 15 MB, the notebook automatically displays a warning with suggestions for reducing the size. Since GitHub's GIF limit is 10 MB, this lets you catch the issue before trying to embed it in a README.

- **Playback speed adjustment**

  Speed is controlled with the `setpts` filter. Bumping a longer recording to 1.5x or 2.0x also meaningfully reduces file size.
```python
  speed_filter = f'setpts={1/speed:.4f}*PTS,'  # e.g., 1.5x speed → setpts=0.6667*PTS
```

- **Merging multiple videos**

  Uses FFmpeg's concat with `-c copy` to copy the codec without re-encoding, so merging is fast. The dropdown UI lets you freely specify the merge order.

- **Separated settings and execution cells**

  The settings cell (step ④) and the conversion cell (step ⑤) are kept separate, so if you want to re-convert with different quality settings, you only need to re-run step ⑤ — no need to restart from the beginning.

### Platform Size Limits

Limits vary by platform, so here's a reference. Zenn's 3 MB cap is quite strict — a realistic target is the SNS / Lightweight preset (640px / 10fps / 128 colors) combined with 1.5x playback speed.

| Platform | Supported Formats | Size Limit |
|:---|:---|:---|
| GitHub README | GIF / MP4 / MOV | 100 MB (video) / 10 MB (GIF) |
| Zenn | GIF | 3 MB |
| Qiita | GIF / MP4 | 100 MB |
| X (standard) | MP4 / MOV | 512 MB |
| Slack | GIF / MP4 / MOV and more | 1 GB |

### Wrapping Up

Three things aligned: I was tired of looking up FFmpeg commands every time, I didn't want to keep paying for a SaaS conversion tool, and I didn't want to install yet another local app. So I built this myself.

Packaging it as a Google Colab notebook means it runs in any browser, anywhere, with a GUI for all the settings. Personally, attaching GIFs to READMEs has gotten dramatically easier since I started using it.

If you've ever thought "converting demo videos is such a pain every time," I hope this helps.
