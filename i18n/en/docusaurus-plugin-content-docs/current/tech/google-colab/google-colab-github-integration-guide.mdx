*2026/01/19 Update: Rewritten to reflect the latest environment.*

This guide explains practical steps to transition Python code created in Google Colab into a full-scale development flow using VSCode on MacBook and GitHub. For those who have been developing exclusively on Colab, we will cover specific steps to establish version control with GitHub and build a comfortable local editing environment with VSCode, streamlining your development process.

- **Repository Preparation**: Setting up the environment on GitHub.
- **Initial Integration**: Securely migrating code from Colab to GitHub.
- **Local Environment**: Setting up VSCode for editing.
- **Workflow**: Establishing a daily development cycle.

### 1. Preparing the GitHub Repository

First, prepare a "box" (repository) on GitHub to accept the files from Colab.

![Creating a GitHub Repository](/img/colab_github_01_create_new_repo.png)

1.  Log in to GitHub and select `New repository` from the `+` icon in the top right corner.
2.  Enter a name in `Repository name` (e.g., `colab-data-analysis`).
3.  Select `Public` or `Private`. Private is recommended for personal projects.
4.  Check `Add a README file` under `Initialize this repository with:`.
    *   *Note: Creating a README here automatically generates the `main` branch, making the subsequent Colab integration smoother.*
5.  Click the `Create repository` button to finish.

### 2. Initial Save from Colab to GitHub

Save your currently open Colab notebook to the repository you just created.

1.  Open the target notebook in Colab.
2.  Select `File` > `Save a copy in GitHub` from the menu.

<Admonition type="tip" title="GitHub Authorization">
  If this is your first time or your session has expired, a popup will appear asking for permission for Google Colab to access GitHub. Click the "Authorize googlecolab" button to allow the integration.
</Admonition>

3.  Configure the save settings.
    - **Repository**: Select the `your-username/your-repository-name` created earlier.
    - **Branch**: Select `main`.
    - **Commit message**: Enter a clear message like `Initial commit of notebook from Colab`.

![Save settings dialog](/img/colab_github_04_save_settings_dialog.png)

4.  Click `OK` to execute the save.

### 3. Setting Up the Local Development Environment

Download the code from GitHub to your local machine (MacBook) and set up the editing environment.

#### Cloning the Repository

1.  On the GitHub repository page, click the green `Code▼` button.

![GitHub Code Button](/img/colab_github_05_clone_code_button.png)

2.  Select the `HTTPS` tab and copy the displayed URL.
3.  Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to save the project, and run the clone command.

```bash
# Move to the Documents folder (or any location you prefer)
cd ~/Documents

# Clone the repository
git clone [Paste the copied repository URL]

# Move into the created repository folder
cd [repository-name]
```

#### VSCode Settings

*Note: While this guide uses VSCode, the basic flow is similar for other editors like Cursor or PyCharm. Please refer to the Jupyter instructions for your specific editor.*

1.  Open the cloned folder in VSCode (typing `code .` in the terminal is convenient).
2.  Install useful extensions for development. Search for and install the following from the VSCode Extensions tab:
    -   `Python`
    -   `Jupyter`
3.  To make `.ipynb` files easier to manage with Git, it is recommended to configure them to open as text by default for diffing purposes.
    -   Right-click the `.ipynb` file in the Explorer > `Open With...` > `Text Editor`.

![VSCode Right Click Menu](/img/colab_github_06_vscode_right_click_menu.png)

![VSCode Select Text Editor](/img/colab_github_07_vscode_select_text_editor.png)

    -   This displays the file in raw JSON format, making it easier to check Git diffs. Of course, when you want to execute or edit it as a notebook, you can double-click to open it in the standard Jupyter format.

### 4. Daily Development Workflow

#### From Editing to Saving on GitHub

1.  **Edit Code in VSCode**
    -   Implement ideas and edit your code freely in your local environment.

2.  **Save Changes to GitHub**
    -   Once editing is complete, run the following commands in the terminal to push your changes to GitHub.
    -   Using conventions like [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages makes management easier.

    ```bash
    git add .
    
    # Message examples: feat(feature), fix(bugfix), docs(documentation), style(formatting), etc.
    git commit -m "feat: add data preprocessing logic"
    
    git push origin main
    ```

3.  **Verify Operation in Colab**
    -   Open Colab, select `File` > `Open notebook`, and switch to the `GitHub` tab.

![Colab Open Notebook GitHub Tab](/img/colab_github_08_open_notebook_github_tab.png)

    -   Search using the repository URL (`https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name`).

![Colab Repository Search](/img/colab_github_09_search_repo_url.png)

    -   Open the updated notebook and run it to verify operation.

### Important Operational Rules

To maintain smooth integration and avoid conflicts, it is crucial to follow these rules.

#### 1. Confirm Sync Before Starting (Most Important)

**It is easy to forget where you last edited the code.**
If you make small fixes in Colab and then start working locally without syncing, you will lose consistency. Regardless of which environment you start in, **always retrieve the latest state from GitHub before working.**

-   **When starting locally**:
    -   Run `git pull origin main` first to fetch the latest version.
-   **When starting in Colab**:
    -   Tabs left open in the browser may contain old states. We recommend explicitly re-opening the notebook via `File` > `Open notebook` > `GitHub` tab.

#### 2. Save When Finished

**When you finish editing, always save (push) your changes to GitHub to signal the end of your work.**

-   **If edited locally**:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "docs: update analysis comments"
    git push origin main
    ```
-   **If edited in Colab**:
    -   Execute `File` > `Save a copy in GitHub`. If you close the browser without doing this, changes made in Colab will not be reflected in GitHub.

#### 3. Avoid Simultaneous Editing

**Do not edit the same file in multiple environments simultaneously, as this is the biggest cause of conflicts.**
Strictly follow the relay process: "Finish local work & Push" -> "Pull in Colab (Re-open) & Start work".

#### 4. Dealing with Conflicts

If a conflict occurs, stay calm and resolve it in your local environment.

1.  Check the status with `git status`.
2.  Use `git stash` to temporarily save current changes if necessary.
3.  Get the latest remote version with `git pull origin main`.
4.  Use VSCode's diff view features to resolve the conflict, then commit and push again.

### Summary

By following these steps, you can build an efficient development environment integrating Google Colab, GitHub, and local VSCode.

-   **GitHub**: Reliable version control and code history retention.
-   **Local VSCode**: A comfortable, high-functionality editing environment.
-   **Google Colab**: Execution environment utilizing powerful GPUs/TPUs.

By leveraging the strengths of each tool and adhering to proper operational rules, you can realize a flexible and secure development workflow while minimizing the risk of conflicts.
