This article provides a practical guide for transitioning Python code created in Google Colab to a full-fledged development workflow using VSCode on a MacBook and GitHub. It outlines the specific steps for those who have previously developed only in Colab to establish a more efficient development system by setting up version control with GitHub and a comfortable local editing environment with VSCode.

- **Repository Setup**: Preparing the receiving environment on GitHub.
- **Initial Sync**: Safely migrating code from Colab to GitHub.
- **Local Environment**: Setting up the editing environment in VSCode.
- **Operational Workflow**: Establishing a daily development cycle.

## 1. GitHub Repository Setup

To accept saves from Colab, you first need to create a `main` branch in your repository.

1.  Open your GitHub repository.
2.  **Create a README file**: Click "Create a new file" or "Add a README file." Creating a `README.md` will automatically generate the `main` branch.

## 2. Initial Save from Colab to GitHub

1.  Open the target notebook in Colab.
2.  From the menu, select **File > Save a copy in GitHub**.
3.  Configure the destination:
    - **Repository**: Select `your-username/your-repository-name`.
    - **Branch**: Select `main`.
    - **Commit message**: Enter a clear message, such as "Initial commit of notebook from Colab."
4.  Click the `OK` button to execute the save.

## 3. Local Development Environment Setup

### Clone the Repository

1.  In your GitHub repository, click the green "Codeâ–¼" button.
2.  Copy the HTTPS URL.
3.  Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone [COPIED_REPOSITORY_URL]
```

### VSCode Setup

1.  Open the cloned folder in VSCode.
2.  Install useful extensions for development:
    -   **Python**
    -   **Jupyter**
3.  To make `.ipynb` files easier to manage with Git, configure them to open in a text-based format.
    -   Right-click the file > "Open With..." > "Text Editor."
    -   This will display the file in JSON format, making it easier to see changes and diffs.

## 4. Daily Development Workflow

### From Editing to Saving on GitHub

1.  **Edit Code in VSCode**
    -   Freely implement your ideas and edit code in your local environment.

2.  **Save Changes to GitHub**
    -   Once you're done editing, run the following commands in the terminal to push your changes to GitHub.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Improve user authentication logic"
    git push origin main
    ```

3.  **Verify in Colab**
    -   Open Colab, select **File > Open notebook**, and switch to the **GitHub** tab.
    -   Search using your repository URL (`https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name`).
    -   Open the updated notebook and run it to verify its operation.

## Key Operational Rules

To maintain a smooth workflow and avoid conflicts, it's crucial to follow these rules.

### 1. Sync Before Starting Work

**No matter which environment you're editing in, always fetch the latest version from GitHub first.**

-   **When working locally**:
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```
-   **When working in Colab**:
    -   Re-open the latest notebook from "File > Open notebook > GitHub" tab.

### 2. Save Upon Completion

**When you finish editing, always save (push) your changes to GitHub.**

-   **If you edited locally**:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Description of changes"
    git push origin main
    ```
-   **If you edited in Colab**:
    -   Execute "File > Save a copy in GitHub" and save with a commit message describing the changes.

### 3. Avoid Simultaneous Edits in Multiple Places

**Do not edit the same file in multiple environments at the same time, as this is the leading cause of conflicts.**
Start working in a new environment only after the work in the previous one is completed and saved to GitHub.

### 4. Handling Conflicts

If a conflict occurs, handle it calmly in your local environment.

1.  Check the status with `git status`.
2.  If necessary, stash your current changes with `git stash`.
3.  Fetch the latest version from the remote with `git pull origin main`.
4.  Use VSCode's diff view to resolve the conflicts, then commit and push again.

## Summary

Following these steps will help you build an efficient development environment that integrates Google Colab, GitHub, and local VSCode.

-   **GitHub**: Reliable version control and code history retention.
-   **Local VSCode**: A comfortable and feature-rich editing environment.
-   **Google Colab**: A powerful execution environment with access to GPUs/TPUs.

By leveraging the strengths of each tool and adhering to proper operational rules, you can create a flexible and safe development workflow that minimizes the risk of conflicts.
