This article documents the implementation of the '[News Page](/news)' on this site, which provides a list of domestic and international news sites.

#### 1. Purpose and Key Features

The goal was to build a page that serves as a personal hub for quickly accessing reliable news sources. It is built as a fully static page, emphasizing usability, fast performance, and maintainability.

1.  **Systematic Categorization**
    News sites are categorized into sections like "General & Economy" and "Technology." The HTML `<details>` tag is used to make each category collapsible, ensuring a clean overview.

2.  **Full Multilingual Support (i18n)**
    Leveraging Docusaurus's internationalization (i18n) feature, all text on the page (headings, descriptions, etc.) can be switched between Japanese and English.

3.  **Direct Links to Sections**
    Anchor links are placed on each category heading, allowing direct URL sharing for specific sections.

4.  **Responsive Card Layout**
    A CSS Grid layout is used to optimize the display for various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.

#### 2. Key Implementation Points

Implemented as a React component at `src/pages/news.tsx`, with styling handled by CSS Modules (`news.module.css`).

##### 1. Multilingual Support (i18n)

Extensively used the `<Translate>` component and `translate` API provided by Docusaurus. This approach separates markup from translation content, improving maintainability.

*   **Using the `<Translate>` Component**
    Used for translating static text within JSX. It automatically fetches the corresponding translated text from `code.json` using the `id` as a key.

    ```tsx
    // src/pages/news.tsx
    import Translate from '@docusaurus/Translate';

    <h1>
      <Translate id="news.page.heading">ニュース</Translate>
    </h1>
    // Replaced with 'News' in English and 'ニュース' in Japanese
    ```

*   **Using the `translate` API**
    Used for translating strings outside of JSX tags, such as in component props. This is effective for passing translated text to the `Layout` component's `title` and `description`.

    ```tsx
    // src/pages/news.tsx
    import { translate } from '@docusaurus/Translate';

    <Layout
      title={translate({
        id: 'news.page.title',
        message: 'ニュース一覧', // Default text (if translation is not found)
      })}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </Layout>
    ```
    This system centralizes translation data in `i18n/{locale}/code.json`, streamlining text management and translation work.

##### 2. Component Design

Page elements were componentized by function to improve reusability and readability.

*   **`NewsSiteCard` Component**
    A reusable card component that accepts the site's "title," "description," and "URL" as props. Reusing this component makes it easy to add or modify news sites.

    ```tsx
    // Usage (in news.tsx)
    <NewsSiteCard
      href="https://www.nikkei.com/"
      title={<Translate id="news.site.jp.ge.nikkei.title">日本経済新聞</Translate>}
      description={<Translate id="news.site.jp.ge.nikkei.desc">...</Translate>}
    />
    ```

*   **`SectionHeading` Component**
    A custom heading component to standardize the UI while maintaining semantic correctness. The `as` prop allows for dynamically specifying heading levels like `h2` or `h3`.

    ```tsx
    // src/pages/news.tsx
    const SectionHeading = ({ as: Component, id, className, children }) => {
      return (
        // The 'h2' or 'h3' received via the 'as' prop is rendered as the Component
        <Component id={id} className={`${className} ${styles.sectionHeading}`}>
          <a
            className={styles.anchorLink}
            href={`#${id}`}
            aria-label="Permanent link to this heading"
          >
            #
          </a>
          {children}
        </Component>
      );
    };

    // Usage Example
    <SectionHeading as="h2" id="japan" ... >
      日本
    </SectionHeading>
    ```
    This implementation allows the reuse of the same "anchor-linked" behavior across different heading levels.

##### 3. Styling (CSS Modules & Grid Layout)

Adopted CSS Modules to manage styles on a per-component basis, preventing global CSS pollution.

*   **Scoped CSS**
    Class names defined in `news.module.css` are transformed into unique names like `[filename]_[classname]__[hash]` during the build process. This completely avoids unintentional style conflicts with other components.

*   **Responsive Grid Layout**
    CSS Grid is used for the card list layout. The key is the `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr))` declaration.
    ```css
    /* src/pages/news.module.css */
    .cardGrid {
      display: grid;
      /* Set the minimum width of one column to 300px and automatically adjust the number of columns based on the container width */
      /* 'auto-fill' fills as many columns as possible, and '1fr' distributes the remaining space evenly */
      grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
      gap: 1rem;
    }
    ```
    This single line achieves a flexible responsive design without complex media queries.

#### 3. UI/UX Improvements

Constructed a lightweight and accessible UI by making the most of standard HTML features and CSS.

1.  **Accordion UI with the `<details>` Tag**
    The category collapse/expand functionality is implemented with the standard HTML `<details>` and `<summary>` tags.
    *   **JavaScript-Free**: It's a native browser feature, so it works without any additional JS code, keeping it lightweight.
    *   **Accessibility**: It natively supports keyboard navigation (like toggling with the Enter key), making it highly accessible.
    *   **Initial State Control**: The initial state can be set to "open" simply by adding the `open` attribute.

2.  **Anchor Links on Hover**
    The `#` link within the `SectionHeading` component is normally hidden with `opacity: 0`. CSS is applied to switch it to `opacity: 1` when hovering over the parent element.
    ```css
    .sectionHeading .anchorLink {
      opacity: 0;
      transition: opacity 0.2s ease;
    }

    .sectionHeading:hover .anchorLink {
      opacity: 1;
    }
    ```
    This keeps the UI clean while revealing the feature to the user when needed.
