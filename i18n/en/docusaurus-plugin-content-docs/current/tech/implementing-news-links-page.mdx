### Page Purpose and Feature Overview

The purpose of this page is to create an environment for quickly accessing reliable news sources as a personal information-gathering hub.

- **Categorization**: News sites are categorized into sections like "General & Economy" and "Technology," with each category being collapsible using the HTML `<details>` tag.
- **Multilingual Support (i18n)**: Leveraging Docusaurus's internationalization features, all text on the page can be switched between Japanese and English.
- **Direct Links to Sections**: Anchor links are provided for each category heading, allowing direct URL sharing for specific sections.
- **Responsive Card Layout**: A CSS Grid layout is used to optimize the display for various screen sizes.

### Implementation Details

This feature was implemented as a React component at `src/pages/news.tsx`, with styling handled by CSS Modules (`news.module.css`).

#### Multilingual Support (i18n)

The `<Translate>` component and `translate` API provided by Docusaurus were used to separate markup from translation content.

- **Translation within JSX**: The `<Translate>` component fetches the corresponding translated text from `code.json` using the `id` as a key.
  ```tsx title="src/pages/news.tsx"
  import Translate from '@docusaurus/Translate';

  <h1>
    <Translate id="news.page.heading">ニュース</Translate>
  </h1>
  ```

- **Translation outside of JSX**: The `translate` API is used for translating strings outside of JSX tags, such as in component props.
  ```tsx title="src/pages/news.tsx"
  import { translate } from '@docusaurus/Translate';

  <Layout
    title={translate({
      id: 'news.page.title',
      message: 'ニュース一覧', // Default text
    })}
  />
  ```

<Admonition type="tip" title="Centralized Management of Translation Data">
  This system centralizes all translation data in `i18n/{locale}/code.json`, streamlining text management and translation work.
</Admonition>

#### Component Design

Page elements were componentized by function to improve reusability and readability.

- **`NewsSiteCard` Component**: A reusable card component that not only accepts site information as props but also **encapsulates the logic for dynamically fetching and displaying the site's favicon**.
  ```tsx title="src/components/NewsSiteCard/index.tsx (excerpt)"
  export default function NewsSiteCard({ href, title, description }: Props) {
    const domain = new URL(href).hostname;
    // ...favicon fetching logic...
  }
  ```

- **`SectionHeading` Component**: A custom component that allows for dynamically specifying heading levels like `h2` or `h3` via the `as` prop.

#### Styling (CSS Modules & Grid Layout)

CSS Modules were adopted to manage styles on a per-component basis, preventing global CSS pollution.

- **Responsive Grid Layout**: CSS Grid was used for the card list layout.
  ```css title="src/pages/news.module.css"
  .cardGrid {
    display: grid;
    /* Set min column width to 300px and auto-adjust column count */
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
    gap: 1rem;
  }
  ```
  This single line achieves a flexible responsive design without complex media queries.

### UI/UX Improvements

A rich and accessible UI was pursued by combining standard HTML features with React's state management.

1.  **Accordion UI with `<details>`**: The category collapse/expand functionality is implemented with the standard HTML `<details>` and `<summary>` tags. This achieves an accessible, keyboard-navigable UI without any JavaScript.

2.  **Dynamic Favicons and Fallback Handling**: To enhance the visual identity of each site, favicons are displayed dynamically. A robust fallback mechanism was implemented to handle API instability or cases where a favicon does not exist.

    - **Multiple API Sources**: A list of favicon APIs (Google and DuckDuckGo) is used in order of priority.
      ```tsx
      const faviconSources = [
        `https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=${domain}&sz=128`,
        `https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/${domain}.ico`,
      ];
      ```
    - **Error Handling**: The `onError` event of the `img` tag is used to detect image loading failures. If an error occurs, an index managed by `useState` is updated to try the next API source.
      ```tsx
      const [sourceIndex, setSourceIndex] = useState(0);

      const handleError = () => {
        // If there's a next source, update the index
        if (sourceIndex < faviconSources.length - 1) {
          setSourceIndex(sourceIndex + 1);
        } else {
          // If all fail, switch to the default icon
          setUseDefaultIcon(true);
        }
      };
      ```
    - **Default Icon as a Last Resort**: A default icon, defined as an inline SVG within the component, is displayed if all API fetches fail, ensuring UI integrity.

3.  **Performance Considerations**: The `loading="lazy"` attribute was added to favicon images to leverage the browser's native lazy loading. This defers the loading of off-screen images, improving initial page load speed.
