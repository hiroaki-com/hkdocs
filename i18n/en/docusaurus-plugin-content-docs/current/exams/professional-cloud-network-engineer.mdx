**üå∏ Passed: January 25, 2025**

<Admonition type="note" title="Network Exam Passing Memo">
<p>
It was difficult, but I passed. I probably scored around 70-80%.
</p>
<p>
I had about 10 minutes for review. Not enough time. 50 questions.
</p>
<p>
There were some questions I didn't understand at all.
</p>
<p>
Problems I couldn't solve (or found difficult):
</p>
<ul>
<li>There were difficult questions similar to the last time I took it ‚Üí A table-based question about network information consistency between peerings?</li>
<li>I felt there were many questions about complex network peering configurations.</li>
<li>I don't recall any questions related to NGFW.</li>
<li>There were about 3 hub-and-spoke questions that were impossible to solve without knowing the premise.</li>
<li>There were about two questions on the restricted VIP, which I didn't know because they weren't in past practice questions ‚Üí https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/restricted-vip-services</li>
</ul>
<p>
I don't remember the specific items, but overall, compared to the practice exam, there were many questions that required imagining more complex configurations to solve. It felt like the test writers intended to test applied problem-solving skills, assuming a solid foundation of basic knowledge.
</p>
<p>
I didn't feel any questions were directly from the practice exam.
</p>
<p>
Problems I could solve:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Questions about Cloud NAT.</li>
<li>Questions about Shared VPC (it had become more difficult and there was only about one question).</li>
<li>About two questions on IP range calculation (my IP calculations matched the options exactly).</li>
</ul>

### December 08, 2024 Exam Diary_Failure

<Admonition type="danger" title="Record of Failure">
<p>
<strong>Time:</strong>
I ran out of time. I finished one pass but had about 10 questions left to review when time was up.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Venue:</strong>
My impression of taking the exam at an actual offline test center for the first time was that I could concentrate without interruption, as the PC desks were sufficiently spaced from other test-takers. Since everyone starts at their own check-in time, I was sometimes distracted by the sound of people leaving, but it was within an acceptable level.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Exam:</strong>
Below, I will write down the areas where I felt my study was insufficient, based on my memory of the exam.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Questions testing the understanding of the differences in use cases for various services related to BGP, routers, and load balancing.</li>
<li>Complex problems regarding network configurations involving GKE.</li>
<li>Many complex problems regarding hybrid configurations between on-premises and Google Cloud.</li>
<li>Questions requiring an understanding of the use cases for private access, direct peering, interconnect, etc.</li>
<li>Advanced questions regarding the reading and understanding of IPs and CIDR.</li>
<li>I felt there were many questions about modern Google Cloud services like the hub-and-spoke network model.</li>
<li>Many questions that required a solid understanding of the roles of each service during a VPN connection, such as routers, tunnels, gateways, and DNS forwarding directions.</li>
<li>Questions testing the correct use of firewall rules, such as whether a priority of 1000 or 100 is higher or lower.</li>
<li>I think there were questions that seemed impossible to solve without knowing the default IP address? CIDR? ASN number? of a BGP router? or firewall?.</li>
<li>Questions that required memorizing specific numerical values used for service selection trade-offs (e.g., the threshold for choosing Dedicated Interconnect vs. Partner Interconnect vs. VPN).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>My plan going forward after failing:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Thoroughly review/understand the topics I failed on in the exam diary above, using official documentation and GPT.</li>
<li>Create high-quality questions based on this review and add them to my question set.</li>
</ul>
</Admonition>
