### Networking Exam Notes

It was difficult, but I passed. I think I scored around 70-80%.

I had about 10 minutes for review, so time was tight. There were 50 questions.

There were some questions I had no idea how to answer.

**Difficult Questions I Couldn't Solve:**

-   There was a challenging question similar to one from my previous attempt.
    -   Something about checking the consistency of network information between peerings in a table format.
-   There were many complex configuration questions related to VPC Network Peering.
-   I don't recall any questions about NGFW (Next-Generation Firewall).
-   There were about three questions on hub-and-spoke models that were impossible to solve without prior knowledge.
-   There were about two questions on the restricted VIP, which I didn't know because they weren't in the practice material.
    -   [Restricted VIP Services](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/restricted-vip-services?hl=en)

Although I don't remember the specifics, the overall impression was that many questions required visualizing more complex configurations than those in the practice exams. It felt like the exam was designed to test applied problem-solving skills, assuming a solid foundation of basic knowledge.

I don't recall seeing any questions directly from the official practice exam.

**Questions I Could Solve:**

-   Questions about Cloud NAT.
-   Questions about Shared VPC (though they were more complex, and there was only about one).
-   About two questions on IP range calculations (my calculations matched the options exactly).

    -   Final score: 90%
    -   Weak questions:
        -   [x] Q6, Q13, Q18, Q19

-   ‚≠ê Study the Whizlabs practice questions.
    -   Conclusion: All need review. It's a small set, so I should do it.

### Exam Diary (December 8, 2024 - Failed)

```
Time:
I ran out of time. I finished one pass-through but had to submit with about 10 questions still flagged for review.

Venue:
This was my first time taking an exam at an official offline test center. The desks had sufficient space between test-takers, and I wasn't distracted. People started at different times, so the sound of others leaving was a minor distraction, but it was tolerable.

The Exam:
Below are the areas where I felt my knowledge was insufficient, based on my recollection of the exam.

- Questions testing the understanding of different use cases for BGP, routers, and various load balancing features.
- Complex networking configuration problems involving GKE.
- Numerous complex problems regarding hybrid configurations between on-premises and Google Cloud.
- Questions requiring an understanding of the specific use cases for Private Service Connect, Direct Peering, and Interconnect.
- Applied questions on reading and understanding IP addresses and CIDR notation.
- An impression that there were many questions on modern Google Cloud services like hub-and-spoke network models.
- Many questions that required a solid understanding of the roles of routers, tunnels, gateways, and DNS forwarding directions in VPN connections.
- Questions about the correct application of firewall rule priorities (e.g., 1000 vs. 100, lower vs. higher).
- I feel like there were also questions that were unsolvable without knowing default IP addresses, CIDRs, or ASN numbers for BGP routers or firewalls.
- Questions that required memorizing specific numerical thresholds for choosing between services (e.g., the threshold for choosing a dedicated line, a partner interconnect, or a VPN).
```

**Next Steps After Failing:**

-   Thoroughly review and understand the topics I failed on, using the official documentation and GPT.
-   Create high-quality practice questions based on these topics and add them to my study set.
