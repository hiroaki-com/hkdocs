### Post-Exam Reflections

<Admonition type="note" title="Impressions">
<p>
It was difficult.
The questions were fundamentally based on the documentation, but they were definitely more advanced than the practice exam. I believe there were almost no questions identical to those in the Indian practice sets.
There were many questions where I had to use logical deduction and test-taking techniques specific to multiple-choice questions.
I also felt there were many questions related to network architecture and cloud architecture.
</p>
<p>
Objective notes:
Number of questions: 40, which was fewer than expected and added to the pressure.
Time: I completed the first pass in about 70 out of 120 minutes and was able to review everything.

<Admonition type="info" title="Question Trends">

**Cryptomining Detection:**

- Google Cloud provides best practices for detecting and preventing cryptocurrency mining. This includes monitoring for unusual CPU usage and network traffic, configuring resource autoscaling, and strengthening IAM policies.
    
- Reference: [Cryptomining detection best practices on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/cryptomining-detection-best-practices)

---

**Time-based IAM Control:**

- You can use Cloud Scheduler to issue HTTP requests at specified times or intervals, automatically invoking Cloud Run or Cloud Functions. This enables time-based access control, such as granting access rights only during specific time windows.
    
- Points:
    - Cloud Scheduler's retry settings make it easy to control retries upon execution failure.
    - You can programmatically manage access rights, such as granting or revoking IAM roles.

---

**Questions about External Key Management:**

- Identifying the cause by region or project:
    - Regional requirements are important, not just for external keys. For example, Cloud KMS keys are associated with a specific region, and their use in different regions may be restricted.
    - Reference: [Cloud KMS Locations documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/locations)
        
- DLP Data De-identification Methods:
    - Hashing is a one-way transformation of data that makes it non-decryptable. This prevents the original data from being recovered.
    - Note: Deterministic encryption always produces the same output for the same input and is decryptable, which is different from hashing.

---

**Container Registry (Artifact Registry) Features:**

- Artifact Registry, the successor to Container Registry, provides management for container images and other packages. It integrates vulnerability scanning and monitoring features.
    
- Points:
    - You can perform vulnerability scanning with Artifact Analysis in Artifact Registry.
    - Monitoring features are implemented using Cloud Security Command Center (SCC) or Google Cloud Monitoring.

---

**Cloud Security Command Center (SCC) Use Cases:**

- SCC is an integrated platform for visualizing the security posture of your Google Cloud environment and managing risks.
    
- Use Cases:
    - Vulnerability detection: Discover and fix resource misconfigurations, publicly exposed credentials, and known risks.
    - Threat detection and mitigation: Detect and respond to active threats such as malware, cryptominers, container runtime attacks, and DDoS attacks.
    - Posture and policy: Define and deploy security postures, and monitor and fix configuration drifts.
    - Data management: Restrict the storage and processing of Security Command Center data to a specific region to ensure data residency.
    - Integration: Integrate with external security systems through exports to BigQuery or Pub/Sub.
        
- Reference: [Security Command Center overview](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/security-command-center-overview)

**Example from the Practice Exam:**

- Question: A retail company is migrating its e-commerce site, including its POS application, to Google Cloud. Which compliance standard must it adhere to?
    - A. FedRAMP High
    - B. HIPAA
    - C. SOX
    - D. PCI DSS (Correct)

- Security Command Center
- Cloud NGFW
- Shielded VM, Confidential VM, Binary Authorization  
- Cloud Certificate Authority Service
